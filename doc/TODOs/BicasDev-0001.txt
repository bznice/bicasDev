** Initial description **
The index.html file will contain 3 ng-includes, deferred by ng-if (when one is true, other are false, like a XOR):
    - hall partial - inHall = true:
      - creation of nick, verify uniqueness;
      - pop-up warning if nick not unique in session XXXX:
        - go back because want to join in that session (XXXX);
        - ignore because don't want that session (XXXX);
    - lobby partial - inLobby = true:
      - join/create session;
    - lounge partial - core of this app, table, the pretended usage.

Additional implementations (could be future tasks):
- user can name the session when creating it;

TODO-0001 - hall partial begin implementation:
- add ng-includes in index.html
- create hall partial containing:
  - h1 title;
  - input text to insert nickname;
  - button to enter:
- no logic for verifications for now;
- no logic for pop-up;
  - in two above need db and backend implementation;
- logic for setting true the boolean of lobby partial.
